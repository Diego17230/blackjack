# Blackjack
School blackjack code. Doesn't work as well in CoCalc, as `os.system("clear")` doesn't do anything.

### Extra features
- Colors
- Multiplayer
- Secret "cheat" option
- Banking system for recurring users
- Daily playing money rewards
- Aces based on user input
- Terminal clearing for no multiplayer cheating
- Cryptographically secure card drawing (this is a casino)
- Customization for card rank and suits through the VALUES and RANKS constants

### Customizing
To customize the ranks and suits of your cards, go into customization.py and edit the elements as you wish! However, customizing incorrect values will throw errors.
